## Mie_theoryEV

A Matlab script to derive nanoparticle size by flow cytometry applying Mie theory.

It implements the theoretical model presented by [De Rond et al. (2018)](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.43) to describe nanoparticles light scattering. Using Mie theory, it correlates scattering cross section (Ïƒ<sub>s</sub>) to the size and refractive index of the particles. This enables the calibration of arbitraty scattering units from the flow cytometer to size units, facilitating data interpretation and comparison between different instruments.
